#Visit Nepal

Visit Nepal is a tourism augmented reality (AR) application developed using the platform Lens Studio by Snap Inc. The application uses various tools provided by Lens Studio to produce an immersive and interactive AR experience which is released on the Snapchat application for anyone to use. The application, Visit Nepal, consists of a teleporter that is augmented on the screen of the device that uses the application. Once a user gets close to the teleporter and stands on it, the user is teleported to a virtual scene consisting of the historical landmarks in Nepal, which can be seen through the user’s device. Each of these virtual scenes consists of 360-degree images, audio, and multiple interactive components so that users get a vivid idea of the ambiance and are immersed in these scenes. The scenes incorporated in this application hold religious and cultural significance in Nepal. Mount Everest, also known locally as Sagarmatha, is a literal translation for “Goddess of the Sky”. Being the highest peak in the world is a great incentive in attracting thrill-seekers looking to conquer this treacherous mountain. Patan Durbar Square is one of the oldest royal places in Nepal, known for the presence of both Hindu and Buddhist shrines. It is well known for its architecture and the intense devotion it inspires amongst the followers of Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Maya Devi Temple is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Buddha. According to regional folk stories, Lord Buddha walked seven steps as soon as he was born in this specific temple. Swayambhunath Stupa is famous for its unique Buddhist architecture that integrates a collection of spinning prayer wheels. By spinning these wheels, one is believed to accumulate wisdom and merit while also purifying their negative deeds.

## Installation

Visit Nepal requires [Lens Studio](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/download/) version 4.16.1 to run.

The compressed file needs to be extracted to a destination on the computer before opening with the Lens Studio environment.

When the installation of Lens Studio is complete and is opened, one can load the Visit Nepal project by clicking on the 'Open Project' option and selecting the 'IS_AR.lsproj' file with the lens studio icon from the project directory on the computer.

Once Lens Studio loads the project, the object panel, the resources panel, the scene panel, the inspector panel, and the preview panel are visible. The object panel consists of all the objects in the AR experience, while the resources panel consists of all assets used in the AR experience. The inspector panel is used to inspect and modify the objects from the object panel, and the preview panel is used to preview the AR experience once any form of editing is complete.

When in the preview panel, the W, A, S, and D keys on the keyboard can be used to navigate through the AR experience. W is used to move forward, A is used to move to the left, S is used to move backward, and D is used to move to the right. The right-mouse click needs to be held, and the mouse needs to move in the desired direction to look around the preview panel. When a user has finished navigating through all the scenes present in the AR experience, the experience can be reset by selecting the reset option at the top of the preview panel.

Once all the edits are final, and the AR experience meets the size limitation (8 MB) to be published, one can publish the AR experience by clicking on the 'Publish Lens' option in the Lens Studio environment.

To run the Visit Nepal AR experience on a smartphone after it is published, the most recent version of Snapchat needs to be downloaded from the AppStore for iOS devices or the Play Store for Android devices. Once the application is downloaded, a user must register for a Snapchat account or log in to an existing account. A user can then use the AR experience by searching for Visit Nepal on the explore option in the Snapchat application.

## Necessary Assets

All the necessary assets, such as the 360-degree images, the audio, the 3D models, the jpeg images, and the interactive scripts, are included with the compressed file for the project.
